# SkyGuard: AI-Powered Drone Detection System

## üöÄ Elevator Pitch

**SkyGuard brings AI-powered drone detection to any device ‚Äî even low-end CPUs and smartphones ‚Äî enabling real-time threat alerts that protect critical zones anytime, anywhere.**

---

## üìñ Project Story

### üí° Inspiration

The idea originated from a detail we heard while accompanying a volunteer medical team: frontline soldiers on night patrols are often exposed to drone surveillance and strike risks under severely limited intelligence and detection capabilities. Unlike civilian airports‚Äîwhere drone sightings may cause flight delays‚Äîthe threat of drones on the battlefield directly endangers soldiers and civilians. We found that, even in the most intense conflict zones, the vast majority of soldiers still carry networked smartphones‚Äîan everyday necessity that remains an under-utilized, low-cost sensing platform.

When night falls and visibility deteriorates, small low-flying drones can approach with much greater ease; radar and dedicated detectors are typically expensive or sparsely deployed, and frontline units often cannot sustain the maintenance and operation of complex sensing equipment. We began to ask: what if every soldier‚Äôs phone could be turned into a distributed early-warning node‚Äîleveraging local sensors, cooperative perception, and lightweight intelligence‚Äîto immediately issue actionable alerts and evasive recommendations when a drone is approaching, loitering, or exhibiting suspicious surveillance behavior? Could such an approach materially improve survival odds and operational safety? That question drives our project.

We do not aim to create offensive weapons, but rather a protection-centric system capable of operating under severely constrained conditions: lowering deployment barriers by using existing consumer devices, prioritizing real-time responsiveness and reliability while minimizing impact on civilians; and embedding privacy safeguards and false-alarm control in the design. We favor non-lethal alerts and clear, actionable guidance so that frontline personnel have concrete steps to follow upon receiving a warning. This solution addresses urgent battlefield needs while respecting humanitarian and legal boundaries.

### üéØ What it does

SkyGuard is an advanced AI-powered drone detection system that provides real-time identification and tracking of unauthorized drones in protected airspace. The system combines cutting-edge computer vision technology with intelligent alert mechanisms to create a comprehensive defense solution.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Real-time Detection**: Processes live video feeds from security cameras to identify drone signatures with 95%+ accuracy
- **Multi-source Input**: Supports webcams, IP cameras, RTSP streams, and video files for flexible deployment
- **Instant Alerts**: Triggers immediate audio and visual alarms when threats are detected
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieves 18.59 FPS on standard hardware with CPU-only inference
- **Web Interface**: Provides intuitive dashboard for monitoring and system management
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for deployment from single facilities to large-scale defense networks

The system operates continuously, analyzing visual data streams and applying advanced machine learning algorithms to distinguish between authorized aircraft, birds, and potential drone threats. When a drone is detected, SkyGuard immediately activates its alert system, providing security personnel with precise location data and threat assessment information.

### üî® How we built it

**The Technical Journey:**

Our development journey was marked by significant technical challenges that pushed us beyond our comfort zones. We started with the ambitious goal of upgrading from YOLOv7 to the latest YOLO architecture, which seemed straightforward until we encountered our first major obstacle.

**Challenge 1: Model Architecture Migration**
The transition from YOLOv7 to YOLO26 (based on Ultralytics YOLO v8.3.80) proved more complex than anticipated. The new architecture required complete restructuring of our training pipeline, data preprocessing, and inference engine. We spent countless nights debugging compatibility issues and optimizing the model for our specific use case.

**Challenge 2: CPU Optimization Breakthrough**
Perhaps our most significant technical achievement was optimizing the system for CPU-only inference. Initially, our detection system required expensive GPU hardware, making it impractical for widespread deployment. Through extensive research and experimentation with:
- Intel MKL-DNN optimization
- Multi-threading implementation
- Memory management optimization
- OpenVINO integration

We achieved a breakthrough, reducing inference time from 500ms to 127.59ms while maintaining detection accuracy above 95%.

**Challenge 3: Real-time Processing Pipeline**
Building a robust real-time processing system required solving complex concurrency issues. We implemented:
- Asynchronous video stream processing
- Thread-safe detection queues
- Efficient memory buffer management
- Real-time alert system integration

**Architecture Implementation:**
```
